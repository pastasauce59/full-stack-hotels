# Full-Stack Hotels

Full-Stack Hotels is an application for booking a room (or rooms) at your choice of hotels for a relaxing vacation and brief reprieve from coding. Full-Stack hotels features four hotels to choose from and each hotel has four different rooming accomodations with corresponding prices. To book a room, a user will first have to sign up to begin making a reservation. Once a user has chosen the hotel they would like to stay at and room they wish to stay in, the user will pick their vacation duration via a dynamic calendar. Any reseverations made will be added to that user's cart. A user can then checkout via their cart and check all their reservations in the "reservations" tab. A user can also cancel any reservations they have made if they change their mind.
